# Project Agent Rules

These rules apply to this repository (`D:\Documents\NetBeansProjects\dash.k-sud.com`) for future Codex sessions.

1. Do not ask for permission before making code changes when the current sandbox allows it.
2. Do not suggest changing the model.
3. Always create a git commit after making project file changes.
